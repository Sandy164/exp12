# Binary Search

Binary search is an algorithm that allows you to search for an element in a sorted array in O(log n) time, where n is the size of the array. The basic idea behind binary search is to repeatedly divide the array in half and search the half that could contain the element you're looking for.

## How it works

1. Begin with an already sorted array of elements and the element to be searched.

2. Set the lower and upper bounds of the array.

3. Set the middle index of the array.

4. Compare the middle element of the array with the element to be searched.

5. If the middle element is equal to the element to be searched, return the index of the middle element.

6. If the middle element is greater than the element to be searched, then the element is in the left half of the array. Update the upper bound to be one less than the middle index.

7. If the middle element is less than the element to be searched, then the element is in the right half of the array. Update the lower bound to be one more than the middle index.

8. Repeat steps 3-7 until either the element is found or the lower and upper bounds cross each other.



## Conclusion

Binary search is a powerful algorithm that can save significant time when searching through sorted arrays. While it requires the array to be sorted in ascending order, it has a worst-case time complexity of O(log n), which makes it much faster than linear search for large arrays.
